# Predicting the Subjective Responses Emotion in Dialogues with Multi-Task Learning

This repository contains the source code and supplementary materials for the paper:

**[Predicting the Subjective Responses Emotion in Dialogues with Multi-Task Learning](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-36616-1_55)**

Anticipating the subjective emotional responses of the user is a critical capability for automatic dialogue systems. In this work, given a piece of dialogue, we address the problem of predicting the subjective emotional response of upcoming utterances—that is, forecasting the emotion that will be expressed by the next speaker.
